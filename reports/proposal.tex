\section*{Motivation}
What is the vision for your project? Why should we care?

\section*{Goal}
What do you expect to build?

\section*{Design Rationale}
Based on our class discussion, what is the rationale for your system and the APIs you are bringing together?
	
\section*{Technical Details}
How do you plan to build it? Include a sketch of your overall workflow with all key components clearly labeled. Clearly identify any input you'll collect from users, and data you will collect from APIs and what the output generated by your system will look like. You can use hand drawn images.
